# Movie Trailer Website

## What is it
The Movie Trailer Website is a simple standalone Python program that runs from
the command line. It allows a user to generate a bootstrapped HTML web page
representing a list of their favorite movies.
This program was completed as a final project for www.udacity.com's fullstack
web developer course.

## The latest version
The current version of this program is written for Python 2.7

## Installation
To to use this program begin by opening your favorite terminal program or
command promt on windows machines and navigating to the directory in which
the program resides.<br>
**To run the program type**
  `:~ $ python entertainment_center.py` into your terminal.

## Navigating the program
The main menu gives you 5 choices to interact with the program:
<br><br>

1. Add Movies
 * After selecting the add movie option you are asked to enter the movie title,
 storyline, poster image as an html link, and finally the YouTube video trailer link.
2. Remove Movies
 * After selecting the remove movie option you will have to enter the title of the movie
  exactly as it is written in the database. The ignore case is not programmed yet.
3. Generate HTML document
 * This option will generate an HTML document out of the movies that the user has added.
 It will also attempt to automatically open the default web browser to view the document.
 * If no movies have been added a blank HTML document will be generated
4. Exit program

And finally to quickly see how the UI and how the program works you can simply
load some sample data and generate the HTML.<br>

 * Select option (0) from the Main Menu to load sample movie data.
 * After loading the sample data select option (3) to generate the HTML document and
see the results.
